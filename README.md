First of all, complete and total public transparency is the first and foremost objective when I consider any public disclosure of working materials. Moreover, I attempt in good faith to make as much of my efforts as possible comprehensively published online and available under free licensing. Notwithstanding, there are some instances where releasing complete source materials simply rests outside my locus of control; and in such cases I follow this sequential action flow:

### 1. Link to Source Publication

Sometimes, I work on things that are incorporated into larger works released by others. One example is the early SFVegas discussions, which were recorded and distributed by an independent nonprofit association. Thus, my immediate response is to mirror that content into something which I control and is publicly accessible, as [implemented](https://wooten.link/media).

### 2. Mirror Content if Possible

Other times, the work in question might not be released publicly by the organizing body or group of contributors. In general, and as a rule of thumb, I attempt to avoid this sort of labor. However, sometimes I find the contribution to [my goals](https://wooten.link/goal) outweighs the social expense of relatively proprietary contributions. In such cases, I first ensure that none of my work falls under an NDA which would prevent public knowledge of such experiences. Then, I make a bona fide effort to personally duplicate the work into the public domain, as I did in the SFVegas case for the first three years by recording over a gatekept recording viewing system.

### 3. Release These Notes

That said, there are some day-to-day moments which are simply challenging to release under such an arrangement. The most pressing which I am now addressing are unrecorded meetings. Generally, all internal working meetings get recorded, even if they stay inside organizations I'm involved with, for the sake of securing MNPI. And, for anything that can be made public, I make a significant effort to only discuss in recorded public spaces, often hosted within the community.

But sometimes I need to discuss things which relate to our work in an unrecorded meeting. Often, these chats center around more distant contributors who still fall prey to certain aspects of centralization, which is fine because any transition takes time and understanding. In an effort to spread the knowledge ascertained in these discussions, I take thorough digital notes of the most important points I can record, which get shared in this repository.

## Development Help Wanted

Ideally, this repo would be organized into a Docusaurus site where each organized subsection of note topics has a feed in the header.
