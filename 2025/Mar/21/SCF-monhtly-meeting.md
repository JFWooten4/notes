# Verified Tier Mechanism Restructure

## Automating Downgrading Qualities

Some pilots haven't voted in 10 rounds, so it's weird to have them still enrolled as influential

### Project voting "correctness" as voting influence

Discussed in relation to being a factor in prediction markets which dissociated voting from actual

### Automating Discord functions

Had difficulties with Discord API

### Active downvoting instead of voting new members in

- Rahim thinks people will need to be more active for everything to work  
  - Some members only vote infrequently or rarely check the channels  
- Anke asks if Discord channel alerts are enough  
- Discusses also adding a treasury to Soroban Governor  

# On NQG scores

Which are being implemented in public goods funding

- Inflationary and deflationary  
- Neurons have a cap for bonus weight  
  - No indefinite amount of voting influence  
- Total NQG inflates as members join  
- Governor uses SCF token for weight  
- Very important that more trust is given when a user is trusted by a highly-trusted user  

## Bad actor discussion

Talks about how it would be a long, community-supportive process to "infiltrate" the voting mechanism  

# Jan 6 Follow-on Email

> [!NOTE]
> For context, this was an email sent to all previous projects asking them what kind of help they need, how things are going, etc., in a very lengthy form.

Anke says this was for internal reference to VCs or other startup programs available to accelerate community growth, highlighting that it wasn't a direct fund distribution or grant opportunity. When asking about the mandate and transparency of allocations, the conversation steered towards making questions like these through public channels next time info comes up. :+1:
