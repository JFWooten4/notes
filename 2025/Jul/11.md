SCF In Attendance:  
Gemma, Anke, and Elizabeth

---

Gemma taking notes exceptionally.

Public coins amount is the same as NQG score in dashboard5.

Trying to preserve individual voter identity:
- Protect from individual attacks  
- Don't want voter threats  
- Collective decision-making  
- Don't want people being like "why didn't you vote for me"

Anke suggests I write down the voting specification thoughts through john.xlm.sh and that `alejoskyhitz` is pretty heavy with everyone else on the privacy protection.

Mentions some projects using OnlyDust to post bounties and get rewards.  
Want more open-source contributors.

Says to create a thread or blog.

Anke [affirmed](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1144254446629572629/1393286446730711152) Bri originated the open-source bounties program last year.

### Next Steps

A discussion in Free-Markets should do the trick. We can defer discussion publication to the community timeframe. Critically watch for the privacy nuances which I am developing through DMs.
