# RRe [WhatCan  Petition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1mhdxrs/petition_to_close_regsho_loopholes_allowing) and  [Endorsing Publicaiton](https://github.com/JFWooten4/JFWooten4/pull/15)

I'd kliem  to more thotorughly cdomcuent some of  my repsonses in  a fomrat  usable in future refences.[^1]  The nature of WC's draftying style to  date[^11]  revolves aroudn Google  docs, which has two  main top-of-=mmidn limitations, ignoring privacy and interfacing  concerns. First one was a lack of dark mode, which I solved after finagnling cChrome extensions  for a little bit lol.

THe  secopnd  is  that material review  comments made are (i) non-perminnat in  the sense that dismissal removes the metadata, (ii) nonpublic in  the sense that the  drafting  doc has undergone multiple clones, and  (iii) non-refrencable in  the sense that you  cannot link to a specifgicc  comment in elaborrative  future work.  I'll try remedying i t here with  stablee section numberts.

[^1]: For  clarity,  I  do not stay in Discord  group chats for  extenedded time periods. I madke an intentional habit of closing old DM conversations  (dusciord lets you remove  a chat  from your recently-messaged users in  the interface  while maitnaing the chat history).  I find this aligns with my  stack-based mmental model of only leaving open  things that require immediate action.  Accordingly, becasue you  cannot "recreate "  a grroup chat, I lose  all group  discussion histories once copleted.
