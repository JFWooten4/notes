# RRe [WhatCan Petition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1mhdxrs/petition_to_close_regsho_loopholes_allowing) and [Endorsing Publication](https://github.com/JFWooten4/JFWooten4/pull/15)

I'd like to more thoroughly document some of my responses in a format usable in future references.[^1] The nature of WC's drafting style to date[^11] revolves around Google Docs, which has two main top-of-mind limitations, ignoring privacy and interfacing concerns. First one was a lack of dark mode, which I solved after finagling Chrome extensions for a little bit lol.

The second is that material review comments made are (i) non-permanent in the sense that dismissal removes the metadata, (ii) nonpublic in the sense that the drafting doc has undergone multiple clones, and (iii) non-referencable in the sense that you cannot link to a specific comment in elaborative future work. I'll try remedying it here with stable section numbers.

[^1]: For clarity, I do not stay in Discord group chats for extended time periods. I make an intentional habit of closing old DM conversations (Discord lets you remove a chat from your recently-messaged users in the interface while maintaining the chat history). I find this aligns with my stack-based mental model of only leaving open things that require immediate action. Accordingly, because you cannot "recreate" a group chat, I lose all group discussion histories once completed.
