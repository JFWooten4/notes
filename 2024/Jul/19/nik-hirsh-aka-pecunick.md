Below is a summary of the [original document](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19402353/Meeting_Notes.pdf)

---

## Background

- Past 1.5 years remote: Barcelona, Bangkok, etc.
- Formerly worked at Mercedes (very political, inefficient).
  - "A lot of companies today are just coasting on a reputation that’s 50 years old."
- Experience in:
  - Knowledge management
  - Chat support bots / AI

## Current Role

- Media Data Governance Manager at Red Bull:
  - More granular than high-level roles at Pecunia
  - Examining how law applies only when you control the domain (Web3 requires flexibility)
  - Defining long-term alignment, task delegation, and decentralization
  - Goal: create positive social impact via DAO

## Personal Journey

- Started as a bartender
- Invested entirely in crypto project payments
- Converts to stablecoin in contracts
- Helps set budgets in production with real info

## Why Pecunia Nonprofit?

- To fix bureaucracy!
- Project management DAO
  - External profits go to internal member-proposed projects
  - Focus on operational stability
  - Reaction to chaos in Web3
- Started with Hummingbot projects

## Core Product

- Open source tool/platform for managing remote, semi-anonymous teams
- Project examples: Card game, Twitter API
- Events: Hackathons, organized through community + core docs

## Goals

- Build a professional structure for grants/contracts
- Lean org with ~6 founding contributors, ~20 overall
- Bridge gap between open source and public goods delivery
- Nonprofit designed to:
  - Avoid tax limitations
  - Operate with limited legal resources
  - Invest excess funds into community

## Process Overview

- Large grants split into small bounties
- Distributed dev teams work on specialized tasks
- Replaces “this is your job” paradigm

## Early Days

- Contributors met online, not in person
- Relationships grew organically via referrals
- No face-sharing for 6+ months
- Key innovation wasn’t the project — it was the working model

## Learning About Stellar

- Nik explored Stellar via:
  - Forums
  - Grant programs
  - Online research
- Problem: Discord/Twitter/Telegram all lacked governance/structure

## Legal Setup

- Incorporated in 2023 via [midao.org](https://www.midao.org)
- Marshall Islands: tax-neutral, no IRS nonprofit registration
- MIDAO validates ETH payment address, central contact point

## Governance Philosophy

- Flat structures don’t scale
- Split roles:
  - Workers
  - Governors
- Vote weighting (e.g., quadratic voting)
- Board-like core contributors:
  - No formal dues
  - Can be anonymous
  - Must dox to each other

## Reputation System

- Points earned via Pecunia work
- Must be in top 30% to qualify for Board
- Board elects new Board members
- Reputation = proof of work ethic & alignment

## Governance Flexibility

- Board can evolve:
  - Change mission/vision
  - React in real-time
- Not all members should vote on all things
- DAOs need a center for operational efficiency

## Sociological Insights

- Human trust caps at ~120 people
- Beyond that, need formal structure
- Contributors grouped between 20–80
- Hierarchy replaces social trust

## Community Infrastructure

- Public server: low barrier for feedback
- Private server: focused, accountable participation
  - Doxing = reputation risk
  - Interview connection enforces responsibility

## Immutable Contributions

- Points can't be revoked
- Reputation = effort already spent
- Core must maintain top 30% to stay in power

## Security & Infiltration Risks

- Billionaires could technically "buy" bounties
- But reputation cost makes it economically irrational
- No governance token used

## Projects & Roles

- No job titles, only tasks
- Contributors = only role
- Projects have leads (chosen by vote)
  - Must deliver to be rewarded
  - Leads can still be paid for good process (even if results fail)

## Project Process

- Anyone can submit a proposal
  - If approved, budget held in escrow
- Includes:
  - Scope
  - Deliverables
- All managed through future open source tool
  - Anonymous contributors
  - Voting
  - Escrow

## Tooling Needs

- Reduce manual HR burden
- Lean operations via:
  - Simple interfaces
  - Permissioned workspace
- Tying together disparate platforms into a unified tool

## Bounties

- Bounty board system
- Trusted contributors get larger roles
- Work proven via:
  - Deliverables
  - Social impact
  - Potential margin return to DAO

## Budgeting & Labor

- Treasury pays operational costs
- Devs paid per bounty, not hourly
- Leads estimate value/effort
- Flexibility for asynchronous, borderless work

## Organizational Principles

- No ultimatums or harsh participation lines
- Work backward from ideal scenario
- Decentralized sovereignty is the endgame
